### The Swiss Hacking Challenge starts soon                                            

Dear Hacking-Lab User,

there will be a European Cyber Security Challenge again this year - let the games begin!

Germany is first again, and starts its national online qualification today, in Hacking-Lab.

If you are from Germany and between 14 and 25 years old, take your change and register:
- age 14 to 20:  http://bit.ly/2oGSn42
- age 21 to 25:  http://bit.ly/2EYRP4i

More info on https://www.cscg.de/

The qualification consists of two steps. After the online qualification (which is running until end of May), the 20 best will meet for a national final to find the ten finalists for the European final in London, UK.

If you're not from Germany, stay tuned - qualifiers for other nations will start soon, too!

Happy hacking!
